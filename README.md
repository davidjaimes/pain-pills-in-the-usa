### Data Collection
 We went to this [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/#download-resources) investigation and got the state-wide data for California. The file `arcos-ca-statewide-itemized.tsv` is 6.4 GB and came from the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) database known as ARCOS (Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System).
